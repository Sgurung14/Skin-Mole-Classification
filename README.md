Classifying skin diseases based on photos.

## Kaggle notebook boilerplate

A starter Kaggle notebook is included at:

- `kaggle_basic_cnn_boilerplate.ipynb`

It contains boilerplate code to:

1. Load an image classification dataset from `/kaggle/input/...`
2. Build and train a basic TensorFlow CNN
3. Plot training curves
4. Save the trained model to `/kaggle/working/basic_skin_cnn.keras`
